	What could college students do to protect their personal safety on campus?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	There are several steps that college students can take in order to protect their personal safety on campus:
	
	1.Stay aware of your surroundings: Always be mindful of where you are and who is around you. Avoid walking alone at night and stick to well-lit areas on campus.
	
	2.Use campus security resources: Most campuses have security officers and emergency call boxes or phones located throughout the campus. Familiarize yourself with their locations and use them if necessary.
	
	3.Be cautious with alcohol and drugs: Substance abuse can impair judgment and increase the risk of being victimized. Always drink responsibly and avoid using drugs that are not prescribed to you.
	
	4.Secure your personal belongings: Keep your dorm room, locker locked at all times. Don't leave valuable items like laptops or cell phones out in the open where they can be easily stolen.
	
	5. Stay connected with others: Let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return. 
	
	By following these tips, college students can reduce their chances of becoming a victim of crime on campus.

\begin{example}
	How do you feel about trying new things? What stops you from trying new things?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	In general，People often feel comfortable with what they know and what feels familiar to them, even if it is not necessarily good for them. However, trying new things can be a great way to learn, grow and expand your perspective. It can also help we to build self-confidence and develop new skills. 
	
	I think what prevents me from trying new things is my lack of confidence, thinking too much about the consequences that I don't have the courage to try.
\end{solution}
\begin{example}
	 Who would you turn to for help when you are in trouble? Parents, friends, teachers or others? Why?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	When I have different troubles, I ask different people for help. For example, if I have difficulties in my studies, I may ask friends or teachers for help, and I will ask my parents for help when I encounter difficulties in life.
\end{solution}
\begin{example}
	 Do you like history? What Chinese / British / American history attracts you most? Why and how?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	I like Chinese history because it is very rich and colorful. Its development is not just a single linear progression, but also has many changes and turning points. Behind these historical events and periods, there are rich cultural, social, political, and economic phenomena
\end{solution}
\begin{example}
	Why do some people list the mobile phones as one of the “world’s worst inventions”? 
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	It's because they believe that mobile phones can make people overly dependent. Some people may become addicted to mobile phones and overlook real-life interpersonal interactions and experiences. And the use of mobile phones can affect physical health. Long term use of mobile phones can lead to health issues such as eye fatigue, cervical spondylosis.
\end{solution}
\begin{example}
	 If you were offered a job that is irrelevant to your specialty and interest but with a decent salary, would you take it? Why or why not?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	I will accept this job because I think the salary is good and it can also provide them with some financial security they need for their daily lives. When we don't have enough wealth, we have our own responsibilities to bear, and then we are forced to abandon our hobbies.
\end{solution}
\begin{example}
	What do you think is the characteristic of the way of learning of Chinese students in general?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	Firstly, emphasis should be placed on exam results, and extracurricular tutoring is more common. The education system in China places great emphasis on exam results, and students often spend a lot of time and energy preparing for exams. Secondly, there is a tendency towards rote memorization. Many students use rote memorization to memorize knowledge points and formulas.
\end{solution}
\begin{example}
	What do you think are the most obvious and impressive changes in China in the past 45 years since the reform and opening-up? 
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	I think the first thing is economic development. Since the reform and opening up, the Chinese economy has achieved rapid development and become the second largest economy in the world. It has improved the living standards of the people. Next is technological innovation. China has made tremendous progress in technological innovation, and has made significant achievements in areas such as high-speed railways, aerospace, and 5G.

	What’s your understanding of “never judge by appearances”?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	The phrase "never judge by appearances" means that one should not form an opinion or make assumptions about someone or something just based on their outward appearance or initial impression. It suggests that there may be more to a person or situation than what meets the eye. The phrase emphasizes the idea that looks can be deceiving and that we should take the time to get to know someone or investigate a situation before making a judgment or drawing a conclusion. It encourages us to be open-minded and to consider all relevant information before making a decision or forming an opinion.

	 How do you interpret “The U.S. of America has become a land of lock”?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}

\end{solution}
\begin{example}
	What do you think is the most striking difference between Chinese way of learning and American way of learning?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	In the Chinese education system, there is traditionally a high emphasis on rote memorization, focus on discipline, and rigorous academic standards. Teachers are typically given high respect and obedience, and students are expected to show a high level of deference and work hard to meet these expectations. This often leads to a higher level of stress among students, and a high level of importance placed on scores and grades.
	
	On the other hand, in the American education system, there is more emphasis on critical thinking, creativity, and individual expression of ideas. Students are encouraged to ask questions, work in groups, and develop their own ideas and opinions. The teacher-student relationship is more casual, with less emphasis on strict obedience, and more focus on building a relationship of mutual respect and trust.
	
	These differences can have implications for students’ academic performance, attitude towards learning, and future prospects, but it is important to keep in mind that these are generalizations and that individual experiences can vary greatly.

	How do you interpret “The core values of Chinese socialism” in general ? Expound a few of the 12 core concepts of it.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
	The twelve core values of Chinese socialism are:
	
	Prosperity
	
	Democracy
	
	Civility
	
	Harmony
	
	Freedom
	
	Equality
	
	Justice
	
	Rule of Law
	
	Patriotism
	
	Dedication
	
	Integrity
	
	Friendliness
	
	
	Each of these core values is intended to reflect important aspects of Chinese culture, history, and social development. Some of the core values can be seen as reflecting traditional Chinese values, such as harmony, civility, and dedication, while others are viewed as more influenced by Western political thought, such as democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.
	
	For instance, "harmony" refers to creating a harmonious social environment, strengthened by people's mutual understanding, tolerance, and support for one another. The core value of "dedication" emphasizes the importance of self-sacrifice, hard work, and emphasis on the common good. "Rule of law" supports building of a just society bound by the law, where everyone is subject to the same legal system, regardless of their background. "Patriotism" is emphasized as the love for country, while "friendliness" focuses on creating an inclusive, hospitable, and amiable community.
	
	Overall, the twelve core values of Chinese socialism reflect the Party's vision for China's future social and economic development, as well as its place in the global community.
